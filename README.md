# Lagrangian-Relaxation
Code samples for Integer Programming project on Lagrangian relaxation techniques for resource-constrained shortest path problems.

Repository is based on the paper "Cutting-Planes and Superdifferentials for Constrained Shortest Path Problems", by Matthew Geleta, submitted as part of an MSc degree in Mathematics at The University of Oxford.
